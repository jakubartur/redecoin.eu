        <h1>REDE White Paper - Version V2</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This white paper presents the concept and features of rede coin (short for "reliable decentralized currency"). Rede is built on the Ethereum codebase but has been forked to serve purposes beyond Ethereum. The primary target audience for this coin includes individuals who dislike being subject to the whims of traditional banking systems and wish to avoid excessive fees associated with money transfers. The core priority of rede is to eliminate boredom, making it an appealing choice for those seeking an alternative means of conducting financial transactions.</p>

        <h2>Objective and Benefits</h2>
        <p>The main objective of rede coin is to provide users with a secure method of storing and transferring funds while minimizing reliance on traditional banking systems. Rede places a strong emphasis on simplicity, security, and cost reduction. The inclusion of staking features is a key aspect of the rede project, enabling users to receive additional rewards for maintaining and securing the network.</p>

        <h2>STK System (Stake for Confirmation)</h2>
        <p>The revolutionary STK system in rede provides a unique method for confirming transactions. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, rede does not involve sending coins or creating numerous certificates. In the STK system, users register on the stake.redecoin.eu platform and link their Metamask wallet address. The system verifies whether users have the required minimum balance in their accounts. Additionally, users must install and configure a rede network node and provide a public IP address and open port 30304 for communication between rede nodes. The more nodes present in the network, the more resilient it becomes against various attack attempts, and the faster it can distribute transactions within the rede network.</p>

        <h2>Games Version</h2>
        <p>For gaming enthusiasts, rede offers a Games version. Games utilize the rede network to ensure fast responsiveness during gameplay, regardless of the geographical distance between players. Rewards for games are calculated through the rede Games system and paid out in the form of rede coins to the player's designated wallet.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Rede coin is built on the Ethereum technology but has been expanded and tailored to accommodate various use cases. Its primary goal is to provide an alternative to traditional banking systems, minimize transaction costs, and offer staking opportunities to users. The STK system in rede eliminates the need for coin transfers and certificate creation, focusing instead on network security through node maintenance. The Games version of rede allows for rapid responsiveness during gameplay and rewards players with rede coins. Rede coin aims to deliver an innovative and independent financial option for individuals who prefer not to rely on traditional banking institutions.</p>
